# General Regression Problem:
- In statistics, regression problems can be defined as follows:
- Find $f(\textbf{x})$ such as, for a training set constitued of  $(y_n, \textbf{x}_n)$, we have:
    $y_n = f(\textbf(x_n)) + \epsilon$, with $\epsilon \ \tilde \ N(0, \sigma^2)$. 
- Our solution to this problem will be using the *maximum likelihood* method, which consists in maximizing the probability $p(y | f(x), \sigma^2)$
