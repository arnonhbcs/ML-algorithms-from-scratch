# ML From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of some Machine Learning algorithms built **from scratch**, using only **NumPy** for basic numeric operations and mathematical calculations. The goal is to strengthen the understanding of how these models work internally, without relying on high-level libraries (such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow).

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: A basic linear regression model.
- **Logistic Regression**: A linear classifier based on the logistic (sigmoid) function.
- **Decision Tree**: A decision tree for classification or regression tasks.
- **Neural Network**: A simple neural network with one hidden layer.

Each algorithm includes an example problem (regression or classification) that demonstrates how to use it and how to evaluate its performance.
